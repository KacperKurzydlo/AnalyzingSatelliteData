# AnalyzingSatelliteData

My first project that focused on working with given data. 
Here with satellite data obtained from NASA. 
Project loads any number of NASA files and plots mean temperature for given years. 

Implemented different plots for visualization:
- mean temp. of night and day over years in data,
- mean temp. in chosen year/years,
- mean temp. in chosen month/months of chosen year/years.

All results are plotted with standard deviation for weighted arithmetic mean.
